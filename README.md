## Introduction
This is a project consisting of 2 different maps showing the number and rate of infection in 2020
during the Covid-19 pandemic. These interactive maps allow you to inspect infection levels in each
county of the contiguous US. Click on the links in the following sections to view the interactive
maps!

## Map 1
[Map 1](https://Frostycs.github.io/FS-US_Covid_2020/map1.html) is a choropleth map showing Covid-19
cases per 1000 residents in
the given county. It gives an idea of the proportion of the population that was infected in the year
2020. You can hover over the counties to see the rates. Note: highest infection rates are
represented in black, which means more than 90 out of 1000 residents have been infected by the
virus. These counties seem to be majorly rural.

## Map 2
[Map 2](https://Frostycs.github.io/FS-US_Covid_2020/map2.html)
is a proportional symbols map that shows the exact number of cases and deaths for each county. You
can click on any circle to see the specific numbers. The size of the circle represents the number
of infections, not deaths. However, the number of deaths id is shown in the pop-up if you click on a
circle.
